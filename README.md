# Wifi-bot
A python script that helps you to find the wifi password for a wifi network on your computer

Wi-fi bot allows people to access the passwords for different wi-fi networks that have already been connected to your device. You type the name of the wi-fi ntwork in the input box and it prints all the details of the Wi-Fi network including the password in the terminal. To run the code you will need a python or an IDE that runs python. I am still working on making this an application that can just be run from double clicking it.
